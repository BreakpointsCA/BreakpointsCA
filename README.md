In software development, a breakpoint is a mean of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution. In web development, a breakpoint is the key ingredient for responsive design. It allows specific styles to be applied depending on the device. A breakpoint, like our company, is rooted in the technology field.

Breakpoint solutions inc. is a private business corporation operating from Montreal, Canada. It was established in 2012.

Since then, we completed successfully multiple mandates for various companies. From SMBs to multinational listed companies, we were able to meet and exceed our customer expectations.

We mainly rely on our short but very talented staff to realize the work, but are open to partnership with other agencies or sub-contractors.
